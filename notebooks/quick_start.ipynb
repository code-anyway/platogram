        "Using this Notebook you can transform a an audio from YouTube or any source (Google Drive, Fathom, etc.) into paragraphs that spark joy. The resulting text is intended to be a lossless readable representation of the original audio, and will contain references to original transcript of the audio. You will also get summary and title.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally you can store the results in the library and prompt it to generate new content with references to the original audio and transcript, or query it to retrieve paragraphs and underlying transcript.\n",

              "This text explores the concept of self and our relationship with the universe, challenging traditional notions of individuality and separateness. The speaker argues that our common understanding of \"I\" as a separate entity is a misconception, proposing instead that we are part of a unified, interconnected process with our environment. They discuss how this misunderstanding has led to a hostile approach to nature and technology, causing environmental damage. The talk covers various philosophical and scientific perspectives, including ideas from Alfred North Whitehead, Hindu concepts of Maya, and modern physics. The speaker emphasizes the need for a transformation in human consciousness to better align with this interconnected reality, suggesting that such a shift is crucial for responsible use of technology and addressing environmental issues. The discussion concludes by proposing practical steps, such as establishing institutes for ecological technology, to implement this new understanding in real-world scenarios.\n",

Of the way in which<br>4. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2914'>48:34</a>: every living being depends upon innumerable other living beings of all species. And also<br>5. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2915'>48:35</a>: upon inanimate forces. Air, water, temperature, gases, vegetation and all sorts of things.<br>6. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2916'>48:36</a>: And this is one of the most important sciences that we can possibly study today. Because<br>7. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2917'>48:37</a>: we are in a position where we realize that we cannot help interfering with the world.<br>8. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2918'>48:38</a>: To be alive is to interfere. You must interfere. You cannot go back and say: Hands off nature.<br>9. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2919'>48:39</a>: let's leave it all alone. Because you're stuck with it. Especially once you've started to<br>10. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2920'>48:40</a>: interfere in a major way. We have so altered our environment that there is no hope for<br>11. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2921'>48:41</a>: it but to go ahead. But we can, to some extent, change direction. But the only way that I<br>12. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2922'>48:42</a>: can see of our effectively changing direction is through a transformation of the feeling<br>13. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2923'>48:43</a>: that we have of our own existence and of what we mean by I.

I<br>3. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2935'>48:55</a>: largely stands for your personality. Your role in life. And the very word person, as<br>4. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2936'>48:56</a>: you probably know, comes from the Latin persona. A word originally used for the mask worn by<br>5. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2937'>48:57</a>: actors in Graeco-Roman drama. That through which sound comes, because the mask had a<br>6. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2938'>48:58</a>: mega phonic mouth to carry the voice an open air theaters. So when you speak of being a<br>7. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2939'>48:59</a>: real person, it really means being a genuine fake. Because the personality is only the<br>8. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2940'>49:00</a>: front. What is behind it? Well of course the organism is behind it. The whole organism.<br>9. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2941'>49:01</a>: And we must be very careful not to confuse the organism with various symbols that we<br>10. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2942'>49:02</a>: have for it, because those symbols can be extremely misleading. If we say the organism<br>11. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2943'>49:03</a>: is the body, what we usually mean by the body, is an impoverished meaning. When we speak<br>12. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2944'>49:04</a>: of my body that is to say my vehicle, my physical automobile. That is an unenriched meaning<br>13. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2945'>49:05</a>: of the word body. Because what you really are as a body, as a living organism, is not<br>14. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2946'>49:06</a>: some sort of separate existence coated by a skin which divides you from the rest of<br>15. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2947'>49:07</a>: the world. Shakespeare has King John saying to Hubert: \"Within this wall of flesh there<br>16. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2948'>49:08</a>: is a soul counts thee her creditor.\" Within this wall of flesh: the skin considered as<br>17. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2949'>49:09</a>: a barrier. When actually, from a biological point of view, the human skin and all skins<br>18. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2950'>49:10</a>: are osmotic membranes. You know when you get something by osmosis. By sort of soaking it<br>19. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2951'>49:11</a>: in. So in the same way one's skin is a spongy construction full of holes. Full of communicators,<br>20. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2952'>49:12</a>: nerve endings. And your skin is simply a vibrating membrane through which the so-called external<br>21. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2953'>49:13</a>: world flows into you and through you. So that you yourself actually are not so much an entity<br>22. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2954'>49:14</a>: that moves around in an environment. You are much more like a whirlpool in a stream. And,<br>23. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2955'>49:15</a>: as you know, the whirlpool is constant only in its doing, that is to say in its whirling.<br>24. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=2956'>49:16</a>: And you could recognize individual whirligigs in a stream.

Anything that we can become aware of is sort<br>11. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=179'>02:59</a>: of other. There is an opposition apparently between the knower and the known. And so we<br>12. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=186'>03:06</a>: talk about facing reality. We talk about coming into this world. As if somehow we didn't belong.<br>13. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=196'>03:16</a>: As if instead of being leaves growing out of a tree we were a lot of birds that had<br>14. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=201'>03:21</a>: alighted on bare branches. And it has become common sense for most people living in the<br>15. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=210'>03:30</a>: twentieth century today to adopt the nineteenth century philosophy of science. Which interprets<br>16. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=220'>03:40</a>: the physical universe outside human bodies as being a mechanical contraption which is<br>17. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=229'>03:49</a>: essentially stupid, unfeeling automatic, Composed of mainly geological elements: rocks gases<br>18. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=240'>04:00</a>: and so forth. And therefore we feel rather alone and left out of this thing. In contrast<br>19. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=248'>04:08</a>: with the ideas of Ptolemaic astronomy. Instead of being at the center of the universe. We<br>20. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=257'>04:17</a>: are on the outer limits of a minor galaxy revolving around an unimportant star. On a<br>21. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=265'>04:25</a>: small minute ball of rock. And therefore that astronomical way of looking at things is simply<br>22. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=275'>04:35</a>: overwhelming. It makes us feel not only of no importance but also very much left out.<br>23. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=284'>04:44</a>: And as a result, that is the common sense of most people living today.<br>24. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=290'>04:50</a>: We did of course have a religious view of our nature that we were the children of a<br>25. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=294'>04:54</a>: loving God who is in charge of this whole operation.

A great many people think they ought to believe it and would like to believe<br>27. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=306'>05:06</a>: in it but they don't. Most ministers that I know don't believe it but they feel guilty<br>28. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=311'>05:11</a>: about this because they feel they ought to. But it became implausible. There never was<br>29. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=317'>05:17</a>: a serious argument against it. It simply became unthinkable in comparison with the dimensions<br>30. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=323'>05:23</a>: of the universe as we now see it. So having lost a way of looking at the world, an image<br>31. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=332'>05:32</a>: of the world which gave us some sense of meaning, we now have an image of the world which gives<br>32. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=337'>05:37</a>: us none at all. And so we feel rather inclined to put up a fight against the whole show.<br>33. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=346'>05:46</a>: Interestingly enough, when in the nineteenth century we switched our common sense from<br>34. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=352'>05:52</a>: supernaturalism to naturalism, one would think that a naturalist would be a person who love<br>35. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=360'>06:00</a>: nature. Just as a materialist ought to be a person who loves material but certainly<br>36. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=364'>06:04</a>: isn't. With what is called a philosophy of scientific naturalism. Naturalism is used<br>37. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=374'>06:14</a>: in a negative way. It has nothing to do with being natural it has something to do with<br>38. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=380'>06:20</a>: being not supernatural, Merely natural. And all sorts of phrases with coined in that epoch<br>39. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=387'>06:27</a>: which I would call put down phrases. Freud spoke of the basic psychic energy as Libido,<br>40. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=396'>06:36</a>: which means blind lust. People like Ernst Hegel spoke of the universe as being a manifestation<br>41. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=404'>06:44</a>: of blind energy. Think of that put down word blind. And therefore we also speak of unconscious<br>42. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=413'>06:53</a>: mental mechanisms. And the very word unconscious as being the deeper aspect of our psyche is<br>43. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=421'>07:01</a>: a negative word and a put down word. So is to say what you are functioning as a rational<br>44. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=429'>07:09</a>: ego with values and with a capacity to love, is simply the epiphenomenon of a purely mechanical<br>45. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=441'>07:21</a>: process. To bad. So as a result of this so-called naturalism we began to put up the most whopping<br>46. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=449'>07:29</a>: fight against nature that was ever engaged in. And that fight is an expression of our<br>47. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=455'>07:35</a>: fury and of a feeling of being left out. So that the technological experiment which became<br>48. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=464'>07:44</a>: possible as a result of the mechanical Sciences has largely been conducted in a spirit of<br>49. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=471'>07:51</a>: rage. And the results are evident all around us. Here in Palm Springs. You are gradually<br>50. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=481'>08:01</a>: getting all the smog from Los Angeles. This great cloud of poisonous gas put up by a city<br>51. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=489'>08:09</a>: which is exemplary in this whole civilized world for fouling it's own nest. Perhaps only<br>52. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=499'>08:19</a>: Calcutta could be a bit worse. Or some such terrible slum. But we have done it by technology.<br>53. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=510'>08:30</a>: By ruthless beating about of nature without consideration for what the scientist would<br>54. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=520'>08:40</a>: call our ecology.<br>55. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=523'>08:43</a>: Ecology is that aspect of science which deals with the relationship between organisms and<br>56. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=529'>08:49</a>: their environments. Ecology is the study of the balance of nature. Of the way in which<br>57. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=536'>08:56</a>: every living being depends upon innumerable other living beings of all species. And also<br>58. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=545'>09:05</a>: upon inanimate forces. Air, water, temperature, gases, vegetation and all sorts of things.<br>59. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=555'>09:15</a>: And this is one of the most important sciences that we can possibly study today. Because<br>60. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=561'>09:21</a>: we are in a position where we realize that we cannot help interfering with the world.<br>61. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=567'>09:27</a>: To be alive is to interfere. You must interfere. You cannot go back and say: Hands off nature.<br>62. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=574'>09:34</a>: let's leave it all alone. Because you're stuck with it. Especially once you've started to<br>63. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=580'>09:40</a>: interfere in a major way. We have so altered our environment that there is no hope for<br>64. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=586'>09:46</a>: it but to go ahead. But we can, to some extent, change direction. But the only way that I<br>65. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=593'>09:53</a>: can see of our effectively changing direction is through a transformation of the feeling<br>66. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=603'>10:03</a>: that we have of our own existence and of what we mean by I. The reason for this is simply<br>67. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=612'>10:12</a>: that all kinds of intelligent and even powerful people like, say, Laurance Rockefeller who<br>68. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=618'>10:18</a>: are interested in ecology and in conservation of our natural resources, they can scream<br>69. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=624'>10:24</a>: their heads off but nobody pays any attention. There is as yet no really serious program<br>70. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=632'>10:32</a>: at the government level to do anything radical about the pollution of water, the waste of<br>71. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=639'>10:39</a>: water, pollution of air and the general ravaging of the United States of America. I'm amazed<br>72. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=648'>10:48</a>: that congressman can pass a bill imposing severe penalties on anyone who burns the American<br>73. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=654'>10:54</a>: flag, whereas they are responsible for burning that for which the flag stands. The United<br>74. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=660'>11:00</a>: States as a territory, as a people, and as a biological manifestation. That is an example<br>75. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=670'>11:10</a>: of our perennial confusion of symbols with realities. Which is in a way at the heart<br>76. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=678'>11:18</a>: of the trouble because what we think of as I is much more a symbol than it is a reality.<br>77. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=687'>11:27</a>: The living organism, the whole mind-body, is much more than anything we mean by I. I<br>78. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=696'>11:36</a>: largely stands for your personality. Your role in life. And the very word person, as<br>79. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=705'>11:45</a>: you probably know, comes from the Latin persona. A word originally used for the mask worn by<br>80. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=713'>11:53</a>: actors in Graeco-Roman drama. That through which sound comes, because the mask had a<br>81. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=719'>11:59</a>: mega phonic mouth to carry the voice an open air theaters. So when you speak of being a<br>82. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=726'>12:06</a>: real person, it really means being a genuine fake. Because the personality is only the<br>83. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=734'>12:14</a>: front. What is behind it? Well of course the organism is behind it. The whole organism.<br>84. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=744'>12:24</a>: And we must be very careful not to confuse the organism with various symbols that we<br>85. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=751'>12:31</a>: have for it, because those symbols can be extremely misleading. If we say the organism<br>86. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=757'>12:37</a>: is the body, what we usually mean by the body, is an impoverished meaning. When we speak<br>87. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=767'>12:47</a>: of my body that is to say my vehicle, my physical automobile. That is an unenriched meaning<br>88. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=777'>12:57</a>: of the word body. Because what you really are as a body, as a living organism, is not<br>89. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=787'>13:07</a>: some sort of separate existence coated by a skin which divides you from the rest of<br>90. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=795'>13:15</a>: the world. Shakespeare has King John saying to Hubert: \"Within this wall of flesh there<br>91. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=802'>13:22</a>: is a soul counts thee her creditor.\" Within this wall of flesh: the skin considered as<br>92. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=809'>13:29</a>: a barrier. When actually, from a biological point of view, the human skin and all skins<br>93. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=816'>13:36</a>: are osmotic membranes. You know when you get something by osmosis. By sort of soaking it<br>94. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=824'>13:44</a>: in. So in the same way one's skin is a spongy construction full of holes. Full of communicators,<br>95. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=832'>13:52</a>: nerve endings. And your skin is simply a vibrating membrane through which the so-called external<br>96. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=842'>14:02</a>: world flows into you and through you. So that you yourself actually are not so much an entity<br>97. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=855'>14:15</a>: that moves around in an environment. You are much more like a whirlpool in a stream. And,<br>98. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=871'>14:31</a>: as you know, the whirlpool is constant only in its doing, that is to say in its whirling.<br>99. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=877'>14:37</a>: And you could recognize individual whirligigs in a stream. But the water is flowing through<br>100. <a href='https://youtu.be/NvLlpY9vd9E#t=884'>14:44</a>: them all the time. They are never the same but for a second. And so it is also with us.</details>"
